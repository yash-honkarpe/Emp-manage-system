# Employee Management System

This **Employee Management System** is a web application where one **Admin** manages and assigns tasks to **5 Employees**. The admin can log in to the system to view employees and assign them tasks. Each employee has their own account to track tasks assigned to them. This project is built using **React** and **Vite** for the frontend, with basic authentication and task management features.

## Features

- **Admin Login**: Admin can log in and manage the employees.
- **Employee Login**: Employees can log in and view tasks assigned to them.
- **Task Assignment**: The admin can assign tasks to employees.
- **Task View**: Employees can view their assigned tasks.

## Demo

- Admin can log in using the following credentials:
  - **Email**: `admin@me.com`
  - **Password**: `123`

- Employees can log in using their respective credentials:
  - **Employee 1**:
    - **Email**: `employee1@example.com`
    - **Password**: `123`
  - **Employee 2**:
    - **Email**: `employee2@example.com`
    - **Password**: `123`
  - **Employee 3**:
    - **Email**: `employee3@example.com`
    - **Password**: `123`
  - **Employee 4**:
    - **Email**: `employee4@example.com`
    - **Password**: `123`
  - **Employee 5**:
    - **Email**: `employee5@example.com`
    - **Password**: `123`
   

  ## Known Bugs
  
  - **Task Assignment Bug**: The **Admin** needs to assign tasks **twice** due to a bug in the task assignment feature. The task might not appear on the employeeâ€™s dashboard immediately after being assigned the first time. Reassigning the task a second time will make it visible. This will be fixed in a future release.
